[Pupilfirst](https://www.pupilfirst.org/) is a mission based organisation striving toward bringing emerging industry technologies to university students and faculty across India. 

Pupilfirst in partnership with Electric Vehicle ecosystem leader Micelio is offering this jointly developed course to undergraduate students across India in order to meet the growing demand for E-mobility in India.

[Micelio](https://www.micelio.com) is a clean mobility startup founded by Shreyas Shibulal, son of Mr. S. D. Shibulal, Co-Founder and ex-CEO of Infosys. The ikigai of Micelio is to enable an ecosystem that will allow clean mobility start ups to thrive and deliver practical carbon reduction outcomes in day to day world applications. 

## The Four Companies

Micelio comprises of 4 companies – Micelio Fund, Micelio Studio, Micelio Motors and Lightning Logistics. 

**Micelio Fund** is a clean mobility focused fund that invests patient capital into clean mobility technologies and business models. The fund looks for value and innovation rather than potential for quick growth and hence we philosophically refer it to as patient capital. 

**Micelio Studio** creates an ecosystem of clean mobility startups. It also owns expensive equipment and allows start-ups to them at significantly affordable costs to foster innovation. 

**Micelio Motors** designs and manufactures electric vehicles that specifically cater to last mile logistics and commute use cases. We have started with electric 2 wheelers and intend to expand into Quads, Trikes and Aerial mobility solutions. 

**Lightning Logistics** is an EV – first last mile logistics company that partners with marquee clients in the e-Commerce, e-Grocery, Food tech and FMCG space to deliver goods to their customers on electric vehicles. 

**The Network Effect of The Four**

In being a real-life fleet application, Lightning Logistics and as a EV only manufacturer, Micelio Motors allow start-ups associated with Micelio Studio and Micelio Fund to use the fleet and their vehicles respectively as a launch pad for innovation and trial and error their solutions. Data from Lightning Logistics is used by Micelio Motors extensively to understand Rider Captain’s pain points, business use cases, parts quality index, performance of batteries and cells in real world conditions. The first set of vehicles manufactured by Micelio Motors is tested in the real world by Lightning Logistics and a continuous feedback mechanism enables significant improvement of vehicles.
  
We observe that the interplay between the four companies has sustained integrated value which is greater than the sum of individual parts computed separately.

Micelio has a shared vision with Pupilfirst, that of enhancing educational experience of engineering students in universities and thereby creating a differentiated pool of engineers who are of much higher calibre and skills. Skills that are industry ready as per the current standards of the ecosystem.

# **Importance of Studying EV Design**

The scarcity of proficient technicians in the electric vehicle (EV) domain and its looming impact on the EV industry have garnered attention.  Read more [here](https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/environment/2015/12/02/skills-shortage-means-government-ev-plans-could-fail-warns-imi).

### Now that we know a bit of history about electric cars, let's understand why they are important, and why we need to develop more

The coming decade is expected to be the decade of the fully electric car. With battery prices reportedly falling 73% since 2010, electric cars are expected to be as cheap as fuel-powered cars in the foreseeable future. 

The [EV Vehicle space](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-12/charging-into-the-future-the-transition-to-electric-vehicles.htm) will foresee an increase of 50% incerement in the sales by 2030. The increase in consumer demand will open gates for new opportunties for skilled EV enthusiasts in the market.

While China is incentivising e-mobility with tax breaks, EV credit policies, research subsidies and more, countries like the UK, France, Norway and **India are looking to adopt e-mobility at a larger scale, having expressed the desire to phase out petrol and diesel engines entirely in the coming decades.** - [Basf.com](https://www.basf.com/in/en/who-we-are/sustainability/future-perfect/stories/India-s-automotive-future-looks-electric.html#:~:text=On%20the%20economic%20front%2C%20large,owner%20save%20up%20to%20Rs.)

"Over the next two years, demand is expected to rise three-fold to 15,000 but the supply is expected to be 10,000" said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder, TeamLease. “Immediate initiatives are required to address the widening demand-supply gap… The auto industry itself has stepped up it's hiring by 30% and IT/EV has been a major contributor.”

Only about 1,000 engineers are currently working on electric vehicles in India, according to TeamLease research. 

Mercedes-Benz, which has one of its largest research centres outside Germany in Bengaluru through Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India (MBRDI), also visits campuses for the selection process.

Tata Motors has identified sustainable transportation as one of the core elements of its strategy. Having faced competition for talent at the campuses, it has focused on building in-house talent.

“The smart way is to develop the talent simultaneously while developing the technologies,”  
said a company spokesperson. “Building talent instead of ‘buying’ or ‘renting’ talent is far more effective - Indiatimes

Now that you know there is a serious talent crunch with respect to electric vehicle engineers or multidisciplinary engineers, which makes this course much more important and valuable to study. 

**So let's continue to our next chapter and learn the Fundamentals of electric vehicles.**

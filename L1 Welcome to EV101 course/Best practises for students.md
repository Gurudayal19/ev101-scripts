Important guidelines for completing the EV 101 course on Mathematical Modelling of an Electric Vehicle:


## **1. Completing the EV 101 course.**

EV 101 is a beginner-level course aimed at gauging the interest of students in the field of electric vehicles and providing basic knowledge about the technology that powers them. Towards that, we expect the students to complete the course adhering to the course calendar and submitting original work only.

## **2. How will reviews be handled?**

The EV 101 course consists of 5 levels, which include a final capstone submission as part of Level 5. Level 3 to Level 5, where students are required to make submissions, are equipped with Virtual Teaching Assistant (VTA) support. The VTA will assess your submissions against specific criteria to determine a pass or fail outcome.

However, please note that EV 101 L5 - Capstone Project Final Submission will follow a manual review process. This is for us to additionally assess your understanding of the concepts you learn in EV 101, and how you are capable of implementing the concepts you have learned in real life. Resubmissions are allowed for all submissions in the EV 101 course, **except in the Capstone Project Final Submission.**

## **3. Submit only your original work for review**

We would like you to adhere to our Code of Conduct and submit only original work for review throughout the course. 

“Imagination is the beginning of creation. You imagine what you desire, you will what you imagine, and at last, you create what you will.” — **George Bernard Shaw**
Imagination is the key to innovation, so use your imagination to create original work. 
We want our students to put in the effort and come up with authentic work. Hence, your EV 101 submissions will also be evaluated for plagiarism. We have an internal committee that looks into this. Any attempt to plagiarise will be reported, and subsequent action will be taken.

Since this is a beginner-level course, actions will be taken against students who only plagiarise in the Capstone Project - Final Submission. Please note that resubmissions are not allowed in the Capstone Project - Final Submission, and if a submission is identified as plagiarised, the students’ access to the course will be ended. A student whose course access is ended will not be able to complete the EV 101 course as well as receive a course completion certificate. Completing the EV 101 course is also mandatory to get onboarded to the intermediate-level EV 201 course.

**Please note that if a student submission for Capstone Project - Final is identified as plagiarized, the student’s access to the course will be ended, and no further requests will be entertained.**

We strongly emphasize the importance of original work and encourage you to avoid any instances of plagiarism. By doing so, you can fully engage in the course, receive comprehensive feedback, and make the most of the learning experience provided by Pupilfirst.


## **4. Time management is critical, so follow the timelines listed in the course calendar**

“The common man is not concerned about the passage of time, the man of talent is driven by it.” - **Arthur Schopenhauer**

We believe that being consistent and disciplined is your best chance to be successful. We want our students to be successful by trying to implement these ideologies into the learning process. 

The EV 101 course follows a level-wise deadline approach, where students are expected to meet the specific deadline requirements for each level. **Failure to meet these deadlines will result in course access being ended for the student.** These deadlines are kept to ensure that you progress consistently and complete the course comfortably.

Within each level, you are required to complete all the targets and submit the level milestone submission(s) for review before the specified deadline.

If a particular level consists of multiple milestone submissions, it is essential to submit all of them before the deadline. Each milestone submission holds significance in assessing your progress and ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of your understanding and skills.

Your faculty members have completed the EV 101 course, well, within a month, and we have students from our previous batches who have done it within a week. Also, we understand that students will also have other personal/academic commitments and hence, we have set the deadlines in such a way that you will find ample time to complete the EV 101 course successfully along with your other commitments.

The intermediate-level EV 201 course will require you to put in much more effort as you will be learning to design and build an EV powertrain prototype throughout the course and being consistent is critical. We will be aiming to build an effective foundation through EV 101, that way EV 201 will be exciting, though challenging.


## **5. Clarifying your doubts and being active in Discord**

You will confront many doubts throughout your learning journey and it is important for you to ask your questions/doubts, get them clarified and complete the course successfully.


*"I am immensely grateful for the support provided by the coaches and teaching assistants throughout the online Electric Vehicle course. Their accessibility, responsiveness, knowledge, guidance, supportiveness, and commitment to improvement were instrumental in my successful completion of the course. I extend my heartfelt appreciation to the entire team for their professionalism and dedication to my success.
Thank you for offering such an enriching online course and for providing exceptional support through your coaches and teaching assistants. I am looking forward to future learning opportunities with your organization."* - **Souvik Saha** - Assistant Professor, University of Engineering and Management, Jaipur.

### **6.1. How to request for a deadline extension?**

Level deadlines are critical and following them is an important part of your learning journey. The course timelines are set very lenient, but we understand that this can be a problem if some unforeseen circumstances arise. Hence, we will be considering requests for deadline extensions from students.

#### **Case 1: Due to personal circumstances, you feel that you won’t be able to meet the Deadline**

For genuine reasons, we encourage you to proactively reach out to us by making a request for deadline extension well before the deadline using this [deadline extension form](https://pupilfirst.typeform.com/to/H7wEQ200), stating your inability to complete the deadline requirements along with the reason. 

**The deadline extension requests in this case should be made at least 24 hours before the deadline** or else it will not be considered. All the requests will be attempted and resolved within 48 hours.

#### **Case 2: You have already missed a deadline and your access to the course has ended**

* Upon receiving the email mentioning end of course access, the request for extension (over a deadline extension form) should be submitted within 48 hours of receiving the email from Pupilfirst. Any request beyond 48 hours will be automatically rejected. 

* Upon submitting a request for extension, a decision will be made based on their request and will be informed accordingly within 24–48 hours.

#### **Note:**
* Our internal committee will be looking into student requests and granting extensions for students only for genuine reasons. 
* For missing level deadlines, the overall deadline will not get extended. The students will have to meet the current deadline requirement along with the next deadline requirement to continue in the course.
* **Please note that the chance for extension does not apply to the EV101 Capstone Project Final Submission.**

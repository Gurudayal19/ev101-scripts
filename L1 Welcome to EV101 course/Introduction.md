# EV 101: Introduction to Electric Vehicles
This course is designed to introduce you to Electric Vehicles, and provide you a comprehensive understanding about why electric vehicles are important. Through this course, you will gain a basic technical foundation about electric vehicles and underlying technologies associated in EV vehicle development. 
This course will also set a foundation for you to move on to advanced electric vehicle courses in the future.


You will explore the working principle of electric vehicles through video lectures, presentations and exercises, which are all illustrated with real-world case studies from projects that were implemented in this course, so sit tight.
You will also design an electric powertrain system for a well known Indian petrol 2 wheeler to convert it to an EV. We will be taking you through all the basics  and by the end of this course, you will have the ability to design an electric powertrain system for any petrol/diesel vehicle.
And in our next course, EV 201, we will take you further by teaching you how to design a complete electric vehicle from scratch, and it will cover electronics and powertrain systems in details.

## Course Objectives:

After completion of the course, you will:
Get introduced to Electric vehicles, understand how are EVs different from ICE vehicles and identify various parts of an electric vehicle
Learn the fundamentals of Lithium-ion cells
Analyse EVs based on power sources and calculate range of an EV
Perform motor power and torque calculations to select a motor to build your own EV
Learn the basics of converting any petrol 2 wheeler into electric

## What is the significance of learning about EVs? 

Electric vehicles are going to be the majority of vehicles sold in the next coming decades, and this is a sure thing, as many countries are banning internal combustion engines and going electric.
So, there is a lot of demand for electric vehicle development, but there are fewer engineers qualified for the job! This is where you guys come in - the next generation of electric vehicle engineers!
As India does not have many motor controllers or quality power electronics developments going on to contribute to the electric vehicles being built in India! so we need engineers qualified to develop these technologies

## What after EV 101?
In the next stage of this course (i.e EV 201), you will explore the fundamentals of electric vehicles, delve into the key roles played by motors and power electronics, learn about battery technology, EV charging, smart charging and about future trends in the development of electric cars. You will also be working hands-on to build your own EV Powertrain Prototype.
Are you excited about starting your learning journey? We are!
Now, let's begin. Mark this lesson as complete, so we can move forward.

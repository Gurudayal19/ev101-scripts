# What is EV 101?

This course is set up to introduce you to Electric Vehicles, give you a brief idea about why electric vehicles are important as well as give you some basic technical foundations regarding electric vehicles. 


This will also help you move on to advanced electric vehicle courses in the future.



EV 101 focuses on the technology behind electric vehicles. You will explore the working principle of electric vehicles through video lectures, presentations and exercises, which are all illustrated with real-world case studies from projects that were implemented in this course, so sit tight.

You will also be designing an electric powertrain system for a well known Indian petrol 2 wheeler to convert it to an EV. We will be going step-by-step from the basics and by the end of this course, you will have the ability to design an electric powertrain system for any petrol/diesel vehicle.

Don't worry, you will learn to design a complete electric vehicle from scratch and not just converting it, including the electronics and powertrain systems in the electric vehicle course 201, which comes after this course.

# Course outcomes for EV 101

After completion of the course, you will:
- Get introduced to Electric vehicles, understand how are EVs different from ICE vehicles and identify various parts of an electric vehicle
- Learn the fundamentals of Lithium-ion cells
- Analyse EVs based on power sources and calculate range of an EV 
- Perform motor power and torque calculations to select a motor to build your own EV
- Learn the basics of converting any petrol 2 wheeler into electric

# Is there really a need to learn about electric vehicles?

Electric vehicles are going to be the majority of vehicles sold in the next coming decades, and this is a sure thing, as many countries are banning internal combustion engines and going electric.

So, there is a lot of demand for electric vehicle development, but there are a fewer engineers qualified for the job! This is where you guys come in - the next generation of electric vehicle engineers!

As India does not have many motor controller or quality power electronics developments going on to contribute to the electric vehicles being built in India! so we need engineers qualified to develop these technologies


# What comes after EV 101?

In the next stage of this course (i.e EV 201), you will explore the fundamentals of electric vehicles, delve into the key roles played by motors and power electronics, learn about battery technology, EV charging, smart charging and about future trends in the development of electric cars. You will also be working hands-on to build your own EV Powertrain Prototype.

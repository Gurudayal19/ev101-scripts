India is strategically planning to boost its electric mobility mission by nurturing a specialized workforce, with an ambitious target of creating 10 million jobs. This initiative traces back to the launch of the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan in 2013. The initial objective was to introduce 6-7 million electric vehicles on Indian roads by 2020 and set a larger ambition of achieving 30% e-mobility adoption by 2030.

The government's Automotive Mission Plan 2026 evaluates to create an additional 65 million jobs in the auto sector.

>According to Arindam Lahiri, CEO of the Automotive Skills Development Council, the process of making EV-specific occupational standards have been initiated in partnership with the Pune-based Automotive Research Association of India.


# Job Fields & Roles
Electric Vehicles (EVs) as a product and an emerging industry demand fresh expertise and novel skills. They signify a transformative paradigm shift in the job landscape.

Observing the vast and ever-expanding market that India presents to the automotive industry:

New technology (from conventional fuel-dependent vehicles to electric vehicles) and new market bring new job opportunities with them. Same is the case with electric vehicles. Electric vehicles will create new areas to work upon which are not common now but will be heavily required in coming future.

# Some jobs available for engineers related to electric vehicles in future 

## Jobs related to battery segments

Since the electric vehicle is mainly about batteries. So this part will create major job opportunities. Some opportunities related to these segments are going to be R&D related and will be high paying, Some of the jobs you might be called on for are:

1. **Battery Management System Engineers**: Though it is still available in the current automotive market with the incoming of fully electric vehicles, the battery capacity(from 12/24V to 352V) and hence expertise needed in this domain will increase and so will the requirement for this profile.

2. **Battery Algorithms Engineer**: This includes modelling, developing, specifying, and implementing control and estimation algorithms for high voltage battery. This is mostly related to increasing battery efficiency and observing its behaviour over a period of time. Ability to analyze the algorithm and hands-on experience with MATLAB\Simulink will be useful.

3. **Battery Safety Engineer**: This is mostly related to the safety check of the battery being used in the automobile. This might include performing destructive tests on batteries to better understand their properties, testing batteries for safety protocols etc.

# Jobs related to Drivetrain
**Power train Engineers**: Since the electric vehicles will have a completely different power train system as the old IC engines will be replaced by the battery system. This will change the driveline system for the vehicle. So having proper know-how of electric power train system will give you an advantage and land you into a new job. 

### Here you will be involved in 
    * Building and developing algorithms for motor control, 
    * Developing vehicle control units, 
    * Using communication protocols learned in this course, 
    * Developing proper power distribution algorithms 

# There are some more Electric vehicle engineering jobs with multidisciplinary roles, including:

In the field of Electric Vehicle (EV) engineering, various multidisciplinary roles are crucial:

- **Chemical Engineers**: Explore matter properties and reactions. In EVs, they find battery chemicals and improve formulations for safety and performance.

- **Materials Engineers**: Study material structures for batteries and vehicle parts, developing lighter, stronger options for efficiency and safety.

- **Electrical Engineers**: Design electrical components, creating circuits for battery charging and power distribution in EVs.

- **Electronics Engineers**: Focus on control systems, designing processors, climate control, and preventing interference.

- **Mechanical Engineers**: Design mechanical parts like engines, motors, and steering. They also handle packaging and cable design.

- **Software Engineers**: Develop EV software for control systems, applying computer science principles.

- **Technicians**: Aid engineers in research, manufacturing, and maintenance, assisting in experiments and data collection.

These diverse skills are essential in driving innovation, efficiency, and sustainability in the EV industry.


# Conclusion
Electric vehicles are an important component of the growing green economy because they can reduce pollutants and dependence on fossil fuels. Jobs in the electric vehicles industry show great potential for new employment opportunities, and employment is expected to grow in all of the major sectors of the industry. In addition, jobs will be created as the electric infrastructure is expanded to support these vehicles. These new jobs will cover a wide variety of occupations.

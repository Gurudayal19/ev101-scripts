We follow continuous assessments for students in our courses. In EV101, the review of submissions made by students is automated except the Level 5 Capstone Project Final submission. The tests and feedback are prepared by the Industry experts to enable students to improve their work. Submissions go through a set of automated tests and if the submission passes the test, it is accepted, else it is rejected and the students are given feedback which will allow them to work on the same again and resubmit to get a passing grade.  

In EV 201 there are milestone targets at certain levels, where students are given a problem statement and instructions to complete the level. The students work on this task and submit it for review. The coach/TA goes through the work and assigns a grade and gives feedback to the student for improvement. The student can then work again on the task, based on the feedback, and resubmit the work for re-evaluation by the coach. For some levels, the submission is reviewed using automated tests.

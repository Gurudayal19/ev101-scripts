Having explored the diverse categories of electric vehicles and their types, let's now conduct an in-depth examination of the composition of a battery electric vehicle (BEV).

In contrast to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, **BEVs** are characterized by their simplicity and user-friendly operation. The fundamental powertrain architecture of a BEV comprises a high-voltage battery, an electric motor equipped with a power electronics controller, and a single-speed gearbox. To differentiate them from Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), which combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor, BEVs are often referred to as **pure electric vehicles**.

For now, our focus will be exclusively on BEVs and their components, specifically focusing in on the powertrain aspect of these electric vehicles.

There are multitude of vehicle types in BEV's - here's a list.

- **Neighbourhood electric vehicles**: small vehicles, very low range (less than 25 km)
- **City electric vehicles**: small vehicles, low range (less than 50 km)
- **Performance battery-electric vehicles**: these are the equivalent of the classic passenger vehicles, with the range between 100 and 600 km

Most of the BEV architecture have the powertrain on the front axle and the high voltage battery in the floor, between the front and rear axle. This configuration gives plenty of volume for the passenger area and boot/trunk.

The high voltage battery, being the heaviest electric component of the vehicle, is positioned very low, in the body floor. This gives another advantage, a very low centre of gravity, which improves the overall stability of the vehicle.

Here is an example of a Jaguar I-pace Electric car, completely stripped. You can see the inner battery placements and motor placements.

## A. The Batteries (The storage component)

Let's take a look at the main component of an EV, i.e. the battery or the storage component.

>We use the word "storage component" here because electric vehicles can either be powered by batteries or via hydrogen fuel cells and both of these store energy in the vehicle.

The energy storage component in a pure battery electric vehicle is the high voltage (HV) battery. The nominal voltage is, in most of the cases, between 360 and 450 V. A BEV has also a low voltage battery, the usual 12 V battery, which is used as a power supply for the auxiliary equipment (lightning, multimedia, etc.).

The battery is the key component of the EVs because:

* The range of the vehicle depends almost entirely on the HV battery,
* It is the heaviest electrical component,
* It is the most expensive electrical component.

 >Various types of high voltage batteries exist, with their chemistry serving as the primary distinguishing factor. Among the most common, high voltage (HV) batteries used in Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are the lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, lithium-ion batteries come in various iterations, each with its own distinctive characteristics.
> - Metal-oxides (e.g. Lithium Manganese Oxide, LiMn2O2)
> - Phosphates (e.g. Lithium Iron Phosphate, LiFePO4)

**Usually in automotive applications, phosphate lithium-ion batteries are more suitable because they are safer in terms of chemical and thermal hazards.**

#### The Battery Management System
Battery Management Systems are the brains behind battery packs. They manage the output, charging and discharging, and provide notifications on the status of the battery pack. They also provide critical safeguards to protect the batteries from damage.

A battery pack usually consists of several individual cells that work together in combination. Ideally, all the cells in a battery pack should be kept at the same state of charge. If the cells go out of balance, individual cells can get stressed and lead to premature charge termination and a reduction in the overall life of the battery. 

The cell balancers of the battery management system, extend the life of the battery by preventing this imbalance of charge in individual cells from occurring. 

The second most important function performed by a battery management system is **energy management**. 

The key to energy management is **coulomb counting.** For example, if you have 5 people in a room and 2 people leave, you're left with 3. If 3 more people enter, you now have 6 people in the room. If the room has a capacity of 10 people, with 6 people inside, the room is 60% full. A battery management system tracks this capacity. This state of charge is communicated to the user electronically through a digital bus. 

Battery management systems for smaller electric vehicles also include an embedded charger consisting of a control device, an inductor (which is an energy storage device), and a discharger. The control device manages the charging algorithm. 

>  For lithium-ion cells, the ideal charging algorithm is constant current and constant voltage. 

## B. The Drivetrain

Looking at Image 4, we see an example Power electronic controller of an electric vehicle. 

Here are the highlighted parts: 
1. Rectifier
2. DC-DC converter
3. Input filter
4. Inverter

 The power electronics control module has several subsystems, each subsystem is responsible for a control function. 

When the vehicle is charged from a home electrical grid (e.g. 220 V),

1. The **rectifier** converts the alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC), which is fed into the high voltage battery. 

2. The **DC-DC converter** is responsible with the lowering of the high voltage (e.g. 400 V) to the low voltage network (12 V).

3. The **inverter** controls the electric machine speed and torque by converting the direct current from the battery into the alternating 3-phase current for the electric machine. 

4. When the vehicle is in the energy recuperation phase (braking) the inverter is doing the opposite conversion, from 3-phase AC to DC.

5. The **input filter** reduces the electric noise or interference generated during regenerative braking, when energy is fed back into the batteries via the motors.

##S Understanding motors

<img class="mx-auto w-auto md:w-auto" alt="A typical exploded view of an Induction motor" src="https://do7js0tdxrds1.cloudfront.net/6cl615vw8or1epho8kcd62d3asnm?response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3D%22AC+%282%29.png%22%3B&response-content-type=image%2Fpng&Expires=1693398434&Signature=Hof2v86sr1eKcBxJkHWLXxfJzREug3WCzphtv6fdXmZpZfihvCxWWqiolfQjzHlpMeR8X5Cw~rhvU9h1b5hGe7hXCANwQKcgz4tdrmvIKEI36s3cpa-fSZtUVyBzw4u2WOFVMCeiDy54eel1SJlnHaGPeOIsQ~LUUtUtD0s90MR2g3jEfPpPQ2J49r2LuvU0afXT8wzusCo8ueqmNzOc9gGC9TCkY~4vG7bYJfz7QMXnLC2qDEpNGw7DN73iShyI43EW6~8bPsH3FvGeH-GLh3qjNHhXGO5tceO9wfF92MX4RPq5Q97ahLX-DjUFCfmtz5Gk8S~AzxbRIf70hOGgpA__&Key-Pair-Id=K2Q3HDJ6ZAQGFF">

**In our upcoming lesson, we will delve deeper into the subject of electric motors.**

The torque is provided by an electric machine. In passenger vehicle applications, there are mainly two types of electric motors already in use, 

- Permanent magnet machines.
- Inductance machines.

It’s more appropriate to call them electric machines instead of motors because they can also generate electrical energy during vehicle braking. This mechanism is called energy recuperation/regeneration.

You will learn more about motors in the coming chapters, but for now, the basic function of electric machines is to produce torque and generate energy.

When the vehicle accelerates, the electric machine takes electrical energy from the HV battery and produces torque - this is the **motor phase**. 

When the vehicle is braking, the kinetic energy of the vehicle is used by the electric machine to produce electrical energy. This is the **generator phase**.

Having familiarized ourselves with the distinctions separating electric vehicles from internal combustion engines, let's delve into the various classifications within the space of electric vehicles.

There are four main types of electric vehicles (EVs), classed by their energy source. 
- **BEVs** or Battery electric vehicles, 
- **PHEVs** or Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, 
- **HEVs** or Hybrid electric vehicles, and 
- **FCEV** or Hydrogen Fuel cell electric vehicles.

# Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV)

**Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)**: These vehicles are solely powered by electricity stored in high-capacity batteries. BEVs do not rely on any internal combustion engine and produce zero  emissions. They need to be charged using external power sources, such as charging stations or home outlets.

# Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)

**Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**: PHEVs combine an electric motor with an internal combustion engine. They can operate in all-electric mode for shorter distances using their battery, and then switch to the internal combustion engine when the battery charge is depleted. PHEVs can also be charged externally, providing an increased electric-only range compared to traditional hybrids.

# Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV)

HEVs are powered by both gasoline and electricity. The electric energy is generated by the carâ€™s own braking system to recharge the battery. This is called **regenerative braking**, a process where the electric motor helps to slow the vehicle and uses some of the energy normally converted to heat by the brakes.

HEVs start off using the electric motor, then the gasoline engine cuts in as load or speed rises. The two motors are controlled by an internal computer, which ensures the best economy for the driving conditions.

# Hydrogen Fuel cell Electric Vehicles (HEV)

Like BEVs, fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) use electricity to power an electric motor. In contrast to other electric vehicles, FCEVs produce electricity using a fuel cell-powered by hydrogen, rather than drawing electricity from only a battery. During the vehicle design process, the vehicle manufacturer defines the power of the vehicle by the size of the electric motor(s) that receive electric power from the appropriately sized fuel cell and battery combination. 

The amount of energy stored on board is determined by the size of the hydrogen fuel tank. This is different from a BEV, where the amount of power and energy available are both closely related to the battery's size.

Although automakers could design an FCEV with plug-in capabilities to charge the battery, most FCEVs today use the battery for recapturing braking energy, providing extra power during short acceleration events and to smooth out the power delivered from the fuel cell with the option to idle or turn off the fuel cell during low power needs. 


**Only BEVs are capable of charging on a level 3, DC fast chargers**.

>For this course, we will only stick to Battery Electric vehicle (BEVs), as they are the most popular and currently highly developed. 

Let's move on to understand the different parts of a BEV.

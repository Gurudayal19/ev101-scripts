# Step 1: Market analysis.

The establishment of performance parameters is a crucial starting point in the design of electric vehicles. This initial step provides a foundation for making informed design choices and setting clear objectives. To achieve this, a study of the current electric vehicle market, as well as an analysis of statistical data, is essential. Below, you'll find a list of electric vehicles from both India and abroad, along with their key performance parameters. Some important parameters that we would like to emphasise on are 

* Top speed
* 0-100 kph acceleration time
* Range

**Why is this necessary?** This process helps in the identification of emerging trends in proven technologies within the EV vehicle segments. Consequently, it assists us in decision-making, enhances efficiency, and reduces costs.

This analysis serves as a reference point for setting our own performance parameters for the electric vehicle under development. 

**Note**: The table data might not be up-to-date since vehicle manufacturers release new models with different parameters

From the vehicle models summarized in the table, we can extract some trends for our electric vehicle design:

| Parameter           | Value                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Battery chemistry**   | Lithium-ion                    |
| **Electric Motor type** | BLDC Belt or Hub motors |
| **Range**               | Above 80 km                   |

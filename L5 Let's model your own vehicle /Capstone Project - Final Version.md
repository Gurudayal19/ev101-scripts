Once you have completed the [initial version of the project](https://www.pupilfirst.school/targets/12734), you can complete this assignment. 

To complete this, you will need to prepare a final report of your two-wheeler EV Conversion. The report will be evaluated manually and marks will be assigned. 

We are sharing a [sample report template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-W7tlIVT-FMck7cRrN7skvrCDMgvDbQuuv5UVCeWY0/edit?usp=sharing). Please use this template to make your report and once complete, please submit it to complete this assignment. 

Make a professional looking report using the template as reference with consistent font and formatting, and colours (if you decide to use it at all).

# Paramount importance of battery safety


 **Now that we have some understanding of selecting Li-ion batteries, let's delve into the critical topic of battery safety**

We will explore a real-life case of a battery fire. By examining the causes of this fire, we can learn valuable lessons to prevent such incidents in the future.

Let's understand the case of a battery fire and understand the factors that contributed to it, ensuring that we avoid repeating these mistakes while developing EVs.

## 2016 Samsung Note 7 Failure.

In August 2016, Samsung found itself in the midst of one of the most significant crises in its history. The crisis was triggered by the release of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. Shortly after its launch, a disturbing trend emerged as numerous users reported incidents where their newly purchased Galaxy Note 7 devices had burst into flames, resulting in a series of dangerous fires. These incidents quickly gained widespread attention as images and reports flooded both social media and traditional news outlets.

The severity of the situation prompted Samsung to take swift and unprecedented action. In a bid to address the safety concerns and potential hazards posed by these defective devices, Samsung initiated a massive recall of [2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/business/samsung-galaxy-note-battery.html). 

Let's now delve into the factors that led to this crisis to ensure that we learn from these mistakes and prevent such events in the future.

The main cause that was determined was : **Battery Design Failure**

i.e. The design of the individual batteries in these phones were not designed with normal wear and tear in consideration. 

Let's look at a normal cell.

**You can see so many layers in a typical cell, let's just focus on 3 layers. i.e. Cathode, Anode and the Separator.**

As you can see, the only thing separating the negative and the positive terminals is the **Separator**

The separator plays a crucial role in preventing direct contact between the negative and positive terminals of a lithium-ion battery. Any malfunction or issue with the separator can result in a dangerous electrical short circuit between these terminals.

Now, let's delve into the specific conditions surrounding the Samsung battery crisis in 2016 to better understand what created the issue.

In the pursuit of making the phones thinner and rounder, Samsung decided to round off the edges of their batteries as well due to the limited space in the phone, this caused the negative electrode to curve along the edges and come in contact with the positive electrode, causing a short circuit.

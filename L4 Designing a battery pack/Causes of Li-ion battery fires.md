# Common causes of battery fires


**A. Manufacturing Defects**

Production flaws can introduce **impurities** into lithium-ion cells during manufacturing.


**B. Design Flaws**

Slim, high-performance designs in batteries, as seen in Samsung's 2016 models, can compromise electrode and separator integrity, potentially leading to short circuits.

These requirements push battery pack manufacturers to come up with compact designs by packing high-capacity cells into a smaller body, messing with an otherwise well-built battery.

Compromising on the design can cause damage to the electrodes or the separator. 

**C. Abnormal or Improper Usage**

External factors like keeping the battery very close to a heat source or near a fire can cause it to explode. Penetrating the battery pack either deliberately or through an accident is going to cause a short circuit and the battery to catch fire. 

**D. Charger Issues**

Using chargers that have bad insulation can damage the battery. If the charger has a short circuit or generates heat near the battery, it can do enough damage to cause failure.

While lithium-ion batteries have built-in protections to stop them from overcharging, using unofficial chargers can damage the battery.

**E. Low-quality components**

In addition to manufacturing defects, using low-quality components is one of the highest causes of battery failures. By using poor quality electronics like the battery management system, the risk of battery failure increases.

The battery management system is critical to battery safety and performance. It protects the battery pack from operating outside its safe operating area. As batteries form a high-value component of an electric vehicle or energy storage system, itâ€™s essential to invest in a smart battery management system that can detect cell failures immediately and prevent the battery from exploding.

# Preventing battery fires 

## 1. Procurement / Buying Batteries

* Purchase batteries from a reputable manufacturer or supplier.
* Avoid batteries shipped without protective packaging (i.e., hard plastic or equal).

## 2. Battery storage 

* Keep batteries away from flammable materials.
* For extended storage, remove batteries from devices.
* Maintain storage temperatures within the range of 5째C to 20째C (41째F to 68째F).
* Separate new and depleted batteries, or maintain a clear record.
* If feasible, consider using metal storage cabinets.
* Avoid bulk storage in non-laboratory areas, such as offices.
* Conduct visual inspections of battery storage areas at least once a week.
* Charge stored batteries to around 50% capacity at least every six months.

Have a look at the video below to understand why storing batteries and charging them regularly to 50% is important.

## 3. Chargers and Charging Practice

* Charge or discharge the battery to approximately 50% of capacity before long-term storage.
* Use chargers or charging methods designed to charge cells safely or battery packs at the specified parameters.
* Disconnect batteries immediately if, during operation or charging, they emit an unusual smell, develop heat, change shape/geometry, or behave abnormally. Dispose off the batteries if they do so.
* Remove cells and pack from chargers promptly after charging is complete. Do not use the charger as a storage location.
* Charge and store batteries in a fire-retardant container.
* Avoid parallel charging batteries with differing ages and charge levels. Chargers lack the ability to monitor individual cell currents, and attempting to balance the initial voltage can result in excessive amperage, potential battery damage, and heat generation. Prior to parallel charging, always check that all batteries have voltages within a 0.5-volt range of each other.
* Do not overcharge (greater than 4.2V for most batteries) or over-discharge (below 3V) batteries.

## 4. Handling and Use

* Handle batteries and battery-powered devices with care to prevent damage to the battery casing and connections.
* Keep batteries away from contact with conductive materials, water, seawater, strong oxidizers, and strong acids.
* Avoid exposing batteries to direct sunlight, hot surfaces, or elevated temperatures.
* Before use, thoroughly inspect batteries for any signs of damage, and immediately discontinue use and properly dispose of any batteries that are damaged or swollen.
* Maintain a safe distance from flammable materials in the operating area.
* Allow batteries adequate time to cool down before charging if they are still warm from recent usage, or before using if they are still warm from charging.

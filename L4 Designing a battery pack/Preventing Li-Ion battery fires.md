### 1. Procurement / Buying Batteries

* Purchase batteries from a reputable manufacturer or supplier.
* Avoid batteries shipped without protective packaging (i.e., hard plastic or equal).

### 2. Storage 

* Store batteries away from combustible materials.
* Remove batteries from the device for long-term storage.
* Store the batteries at temperatures between 5 °C and 20 °C (41 °F and 68 °F).
* Separate fresh and depleted cells (or keep a log).
* If practical, store batteries in a metal storage cabinets.
* Avoid bulk-storage in non-laboratory areas, such as offices.
* Visually inspect battery storage areas at least weekly.
* Charge batteries in storage to approximately 50% of capacity at least once every six months.

Have a look at the video below to understand why storing batteries and charging them regularly to 50% is important.

### 3. Chargers and Charging Practice

* Charge or discharge the battery to approximately 50% of capacity before long-term storage.
* Use chargers or charging methods designed to charge cells safely or battery packs at the specified parameters.
* Disconnect batteries immediately if, during operation or charging, they emit an unusual smell, develop heat, change shape/geometry, or behave abnormally. Dispose off the batteries if they do so.
* Remove cells and pack from chargers promptly after charging is complete. Do not use the charger as a storage location.
* Charge and store batteries in a fire-retardant container.
* Do not parallel charge batteries of varying age and charge status; chargers cannot monitor the current of individual cells and initial voltage balancing can lead to high amperage, battery damage, and heat generation. Check voltage before parallel charging; all batteries should be within 0.5 Volts of each other.
* Do not overcharge (greater than 4.2V for most batteries) or over-discharge (below 3V) batteries.

### 4. Handling and Use

* Handle batteries and or battery-powered devices cautiously to not damage the battery
casing or connections.
* Keep batteries from contacting conductive materials, water, seawater, strong oxidizers and strong acids.
* Do not place batteries in direct sunlight, on hot surfaces or in hot locations.
* Inspect batteries for signs of damage before use. Never use and promptly dispose of
damaged or puffy batteries.
* Keep all flammable materials away from operating area.
* Allow time for cooling before charging a still warm battery from usage and using a still warm battery from charging.
